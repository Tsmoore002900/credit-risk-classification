# credit-risk-classification
In this report we will look at the lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company and analyze	the creditworthiness of the borrowers to see if the loan was healthy or high-risk. To analyze the loans two different models were made to help predict is a loan would be healthy or high-risk. Model one is a basic logistic regression model. Model two is a logistic regression model with random over sampler.

Results from model one
•	Balanced accuracy score is 95%.
•	The model missed 102 healthy and 56 high-risk loans.
•	Model is only able to predict high-risk loans 85% of the time.

Results from model one
•	Balanced accuracy score is 99%.
•	The model missed 116 healthy and 4 high-risk loans.
•	Model is only able to predict high-risk loans 84% of the time.

To summarize the results

Model one was accurate overall with the 95% accuracy score and was able to correctly predict the high-risk loans 85% of the time. Model two was more accurate at 99% overall but was worse by one point at predicting high-risk loans at 84%. When it comes to recommending a model to be used in the future for borrowers and peer-to peer loans I recommend model one.  I make this recommendation for model one because it is near perfect at correctly predicting healthy loans and at 85% for high-risk loans it is a suitable model currently to use.
